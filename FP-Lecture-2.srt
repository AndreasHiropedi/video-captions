1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,865
So remember I said the difference

2
00:00:02,865 --> 00:00:05,580
between functional programs
is that they're not Tikki,

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,830
Tikki, Tikki, that
they are whoosh.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,230
And right, you've seen

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,604
some Tikki Tikki
operations on numbers.

6
00:00:16,604 --> 00:00:18,570
You've seen some
wash doing things

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,165
with whole pictures at a time.

8
00:00:21,165 --> 00:00:23,760
But you didn't see
how to do that yet.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,200
I said, Oh, that's,
that's abstract.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,780
Don't worry about
it. That's a detail

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,325
you don't need to know yet.

12
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:32,820
So here for the first time,

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,680
I'm going to show you how to

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,570
build large data structures from

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,014
small ones and how to operate

16
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:42,575
woosh on that whole
structure at once.

17
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:45,460
So the large data structure
that's built out of

18
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,895
small ones is called the list.

19
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:51,040
And the thing that
operates on it is

20
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,650
called a list comprehension.

21
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,860
And you can go to

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,190
the webpage for the
reading list, okay, lists.

23
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,055
So wait, now I think
I can do a demo.

24
00:01:06,055 --> 00:01:08,300
Let's try this.

25
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,380
Just checking to see
what I want to demo.

26
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:18,085
Okay. Wait, now I
have to do that.

27
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:22,160
To do that.

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:31,020
I have to do at this.

29
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:39,360
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo

30
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,560
Doo

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,540
Doo

32
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,210
Doo Doo

33
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:07,445
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.

34
00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:13,430
Do, do, do, do, do, do what?

35
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,910
Catherine amendment. You
like my singing, right?

36
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:24,620
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo
Doo Doo Doo, Doo, Doo Doo.

37
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,680
You don't need any of those.

38
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,565
Yeah. Okay, here's a file.

39
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:41,525
So my list is going to
be a list of integers.

40
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:43,400
And my list is gonna

41
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,070
consist of the favorite integers

42
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,165
of the people in this route.

43
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:52,980
Your favorite integer is
Forty-two, same as mine.

44
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,489
Your favorite integer
is next person.

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,680
12. Next prison.

46
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:14,660
35. Next person, seven.
Let's be consistent.

47
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,205
Seven, next person thought,

48
00:03:19,205 --> 00:03:21,545
and somebody likes 100, okay?

49
00:03:21,545 --> 00:03:27,200
So there's a list, right?

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,560
Good. And here we're
executing things.

51
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,250
So if I type, I go into it.

52
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,590
You might use Haskell
in different ways.

53
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,180
You can use your favorite editor.

54
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,040
My favorite editor
is called Emacs.

55
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,780
I'm typing the program here.

56
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,000
And then when I type
control C, control l,

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,700
It gives me an
execution window here.

58
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:56,540
And in fact, let's just kill
them for a minute. Go back.

59
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,650
See. Right. So it
begins by saying, hi,

60
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,720
you're running G
HCI. What does DHC?

61
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,430
I stand for Glasgow Haskell
Compiler interactive.

62
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,860
So in fact, the main compiler for

63
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,635
Haskell is called the
Glasgow Haskell Compiler.

64
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:21,355
It's now maintained by
Simon Peyton Jones,

65
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:24,070
who's a research
senior researcher

66
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,860
at Microsoft Research
in Cambridge.

67
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,200
But he and I used
to be colleagues at

68
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,870
Glasgow University on the
other side of the country.

69
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,760
And that's where
this was first done.

70
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,130
So that's why it's called the
Glasgow Haskell Compiler,

71
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,590
Scottish heritage for
functional programming.

72
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,010
And what's said, okay, I'm ready,

73
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,960
JC, I've loaded the prelude.

74
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,490
That's a bunch of
definitions that you

75
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,035
normally get by default.

76
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:48,460
It's called the Prelude.

77
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,980
And that says, okay,
one module loaded,

78
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,825
meaning I actually read
the Prelude and it worked.

79
00:04:54,825 --> 00:04:57,215
And oh sorry, noted,

80
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,445
the module load is made,

81
00:04:58,445 --> 00:05:00,620
so it's given a name
to this file here.

82
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,005
I didn't write down the name.

83
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:04,760
So choosing the name
main, it says, okay,

84
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,260
one module loaded, meaning this,

85
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,925
sorry, not meaning the prelude.

86
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:10,430
It always loads the Prelude.

87
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,660
And now I've got these
definitions in so I can say,

88
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,350
what is the type, so
containings, What is the typeof?

89
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,090
You can also say, you can

90
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,100
also spell it this
way, doesn't matter.

91
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,590
And says, yep, that's
a list of integers,

92
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,860
which is exactly
what I said here.

93
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,520
And now I get asked things
about like what is my list?

94
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,125
Okay, it's what we thought.

95
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,795
I can say. What is the
length of my list?

96
00:05:38,795 --> 00:05:43,100
What's it going to
say? Six, right,

97
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,185
because they six numbers
written down there.

98
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:48,620
Or I can say what is
the sum of my list?

99
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,720
And it will say 201. Or I

100
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,580
can even say what is the product?

101
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,590
Product of my list?

102
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,210
And it gives us a big number.

103
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:11,930
Let's see. So count up to en.

104
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,410
He's going to take a
list of integers, sorry,

105
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,930
it's going to take an
integer and give us a list

106
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,915
of integers from one
up to that number.

107
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:28,380
Well-defined count
up of n as the list.

108
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,220
That's the numbers from
one to n, c, thats right.

109
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,140
Though I did something wrong.

110
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,260
Yeah, I need to put brackets
around this downtime.

111
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,430
Wow, I've forgotten how Haskell
works. That's impressive.

112
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,150
No luck.

113
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:02,460
I'm now going to program
the way you all program.

114
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,790
Bring up the browser.

115
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,180
Factorial in Haskell.

116
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,715
Yep. Yep, it Is that okay.

117
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:31,290
What am I getting wrong?

118
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,095
Oh, that's what I did
wrong. Thank you.

119
00:07:39,095 --> 00:07:40,850
Write its count, takes

120
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,815
an integer and returns
a list of integer.

121
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:47,120
Of course. There we go.

122
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:56,580
Yay. So now I can say
cout for count up.

123
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:07,055
Write. Short. Names are better.

124
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:09,680
Not everybody agrees
with that advice,

125
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:18,150
but we don't want
that. There we go.

126
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,320
Cout for 1234.

127
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:31,525
Count ten, 1-2-3-4-5, 1042.

128
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:36,890
Length count 42.

129
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,660
Factorial product.

130
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,230
Count 42.

131
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,980
Big number. Await this wrong.

132
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,030
Actually, I want to

133
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:53,275
do that's possibly the Nau
didn't get an overflow.

134
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:57,355
Ok. You can also say integer.

135
00:08:57,355 --> 00:09:00,115
Then you get really big numbers.

136
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:02,480
So it's reloaded it.

137
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,160
Right? Yeah, I see that.

138
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,730
That oh, wow.

139
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,080
Right. This is bad.

140
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,505
I don't know why that happen.

141
00:09:15,505 --> 00:09:18,730
It gave the wrong answer.

142
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,605
I didn't say anything.

143
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:23,035
It should have said,

144
00:09:23,035 --> 00:09:27,550
this is a bigger number
than will fit in an int.

145
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,325
And given what's called
an overflow error.

146
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:31,705
But it did not,

147
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,070
I don't know why it didn't give

148
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,545
an overflow error it
should have done.

149
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:38,020
I do some work with
crypto currencies.

150
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:43,345
It turns out that
literally tens of millions

151
00:09:43,345 --> 00:09:45,380
of US dollars been

152
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,309
lost through overflow areas
that were not detected.

153
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:52,010
So never designed something
that doesn't detect

154
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,450
overflow errors and that should

155
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,805
detect an overflow
error. That's very bad.

156
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:58,340
But using integers we can
see we can get represent

157
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,905
very long numbers
inside the computer.

158
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:02,870
So even the numbers
are not really Tikki,

159
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,865
Tikki, they're
actually represented.

160
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:07,610
They can be represented as a
single word in the computer,

161
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,960
but they are sometimes
represented as

162
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,430
multiple words represent
very long numbers like this.

163
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:20,510
Okay, so now we're

164
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,225
going to go back to the
lecture for a minute.

165
00:10:23,225 --> 00:10:26,640
Remind myself what I
was going to cover.

166
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:39,680
So we can make lists of
things that are characters.

167
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:45,370
And in fact, here I've made
a list of characters I NF-1,

168
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,560
but that's just the
same as this strings.

169
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,150
You can write a single
character between

170
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,130
single quotes or a list

171
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,820
of characters called a string
between double quotes.

172
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,460
We can also have lists of lists,

173
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,975
of lists of functions
that act on pictures.

174
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:05,590
You can't have lists of
things of different types.

175
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,885
Alright, and we've seen count.

176
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:12,025
So now we can do
list comprehensions.

177
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:16,830
So let's do some examples.

178
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,170
So let's define square.

179
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:35,940
So that takes an
integer to an integer.

180
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:41,250
And it will define the square
of x is just x times x.

181
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:46,520
So now I can do
something like I want to

182
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:56,130
square every x for
x from one to ten.

183
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:04,880
Oh, I forgot to load
it. Try that again.

184
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:34,015
And there were the squares
of the first ten numbers.

185
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:38,865
And I want to find the
sum of the squares,

186
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:41,730
the first ten numbers.

187
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,690
That's 385, right?

188
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,270
And we could sum the squares
of the numbers up to n.

189
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:26,935
Not happy. I want the formal
parameter to be n not x.

190
00:13:26,935 --> 00:13:29,980
So x appears here.

191
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,380
So x is called a variable,

192
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,715
n is called a variable.

193
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:35,785
This n is a formal parameter.

194
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:39,250
This X is an actual
parameter to square.

195
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,490
Whereas here x is the
formal parameter.

196
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,500
Of course, I can use
any names I want

197
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,660
as long as I use
them consistently.

198
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,510
That doesn't have to
be X, it could be y.

199
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,000
So now let's check that we get

200
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,360
the same answer
before we got 385.

201
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,370
Sum the squares of
the numbers up to

202
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,520
ten, and you get 385.

203
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:13,160
If you'd hope. So
let's do squares.

204
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,710
So that will take a list of

205
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:23,229
integer and give us
a list of integer.

206
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,930
So we're just gonna square
every number in the list.

207
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,910
So how would I write that?

208
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,405
So first I need a formal
parameter for a list.

209
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:33,535
By convention.

210
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:35,860
If x ranges over integers,

211
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,865
I'll use X S, two range
over list of integers.

212
00:14:39,865 --> 00:14:41,500
That's just a convention.
You can give it

213
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,720
any name you want.
You can call it Fred.

214
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,280
Well, I'm going to
call an excess.

215
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,570
That's a nice convention,

216
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,160
but don't use it to access.

217
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:59,910
So square of x for x
drawn from excess.

218
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:10,775
So now I can say squares of
the numbers from one to ten,

219
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:13,340
I gets the same thing as before.

220
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,530
Another cool thing I can

221
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,880
do is just pick out some
numbers from a list.

222
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,400
So here I'm going to take

223
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:32,900
a list up odds.

224
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,540
So od is defined in Haskell.

225
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,680
It's part of the prelude.

226
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,265
What do you think that lips,

227
00:15:40,265 --> 00:15:42,590
what do you think
that's going to return?

228
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,870
True? Because three is odd.

229
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,380
What's that going to return?

230
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,395
What's that going to return?

231
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:57,510
False. 0 is even.

232
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:02,840
So odds of xs is equal to,

233
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,350
I'm just gonna return x. Whoops.

234
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:14,770
For each x drawn from
xs such that x is odd.

235
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,040
So this will give us all the
odd numbers in the list.

236
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:29,689
I better do load it. So now od.

237
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,775
This gives us, whoa, odds.

238
00:16:36,775 --> 00:16:41,470
Thanks. And that gives

239
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,140
us all the odd
numbers between 110.

240
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,015
And then if I want to find

241
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:49,330
the squares of the odd
numbers from one to ten,

242
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:53,330
I could do squares, odds.

243
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,630
Or of course I could
do odds squares.

244
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,900
1210. Oops, but it

245
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,030
helps if I spelled
correctly, it doesn't, it?

246
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,290
Will that be the same?

247
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,615
Let's find out who it's the same.

248
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:18,369
What a funny coincidence.

249
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,440
Why is it the same?

250
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:27,610
Yep. Because right.

251
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,200
So if you square an odd number,

252
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,640
you get an odd number.

253
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,890
Exactly. And so that's why

254
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,605
either of these happened to
give you the same answer.

255
00:17:35,605 --> 00:17:37,300
Generally, the order in which you

256
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,865
do these is very important.

257
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:42,690
In this particular
case, it is not.

258
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,910
Ok. What was my next thing to do?

259
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:01,490
Right? So now we

260
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,385
can also put these together
and do them all at once.

261
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:06,320
So you can build
big things out of

262
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,860
little things or just do
all the work at once.

263
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,955
So actually let's
do one more thing.

264
00:18:13,955 --> 00:18:17,720
Let's find the sum of

265
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:27,210
the squares of the odd
numbers from one to ten.

266
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:31,145
That happens to be a 165.

267
00:18:31,145 --> 00:18:36,209
But we could do some square odd.

268
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,290
I'll take a list of
integers and give

269
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:43,140
us just one integer.

270
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:49,640
Sum square odd of xs will be,

271
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,930
I'm, I'm tired of typing Xs.

272
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,270
I'm going to type Fred this time.

273
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,340
Sum square audits.

274
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:03,150
Fred will be the sum of the
squares of the odds of Fred.

275
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:14,965
And I can do sum square on
a Fred. But no, no, no.

276
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:17,560
Fred is the formal
parameter here.

277
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,360
I'm going to give an actual
parameter of one to ten.

278
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:28,750
Or I can give it
different actual prime.

279
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,880
I can give it my list.

280
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,610
Okay? So if you sum the square of

281
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,105
all the odd numbers
there, you get 1299.

282
00:19:37,105 --> 00:19:41,590
So notice there's a property
that expect to hold here.

283
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,665
So remember I said do it twice.

284
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:46,785
So let's do it twice.

285
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,355
Here's a property
of sum square odd.

286
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,260
So I'm gonna give this
a list of integers.

287
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,205
I'm going to check
that a property holds.

288
00:19:55,205 --> 00:19:57,320
And what's my property?

289
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,390
So I'm going to use a
variable name here.

290
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:05,570
Let's use Fred. And
the property I want is

291
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:11,390
some square odd of Fred
should be the same as,

292
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,170
the same as is written
as two equal signs.

293
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:22,830
Some of the squares
of the odds of Fred.

294
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:32,380
Okay? And let's just
check that that's true.

295
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:42,440
Does this property hold
for the list1 to ten?

296
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,040
Okay, it's true.

297
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:52,285
Does it hold for
the list? My list?

298
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:55,190
Gay, it's true.

299
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,270
Oh, let's make up lots of

300
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,640
random numbers and just lots

301
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,770
of random list and try
it for all of them.

302
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,270
So now I need to import

303
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,970
a module called test
dot quick check.

304
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:17,675
Works. Yep, and now I
can say QuickCheck.

305
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:23,490
Prop sum, square od.

306
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:29,330
Okay. Passed 100 tests.

307
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,775
So it made up a live,

308
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:35,495
a 100 different lists, integers.

309
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:37,430
And it tried it on all of them.

310
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,460
And every single
time it got true.

311
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,795
To see if I've got an example
where it gets thoughts.

312
00:21:47,795 --> 00:21:52,790
So to naming some names
for these things,

313
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,950
this is pronounced drawn from

314
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,235
and X drawn from one to three
is called the generator.

315
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,960
The arrow is called drawn from.

316
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,880
When you white some
condition here,

317
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,790
it could be odd of x, it
could be x greater than 0.

318
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,550
It could be a character
is alphanumeric.

319
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,350
That's called a guard.

320
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,740
We've already seen how to do

321
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,275
factorial and we've
seen some square Odds.

322
00:22:20,275 --> 00:22:22,465
We've seen QuickCheck.

323
00:22:22,465 --> 00:22:24,460
Alright, I wanted
to tell you very

324
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,915
briefly because
you'll need it for,

325
00:22:25,915 --> 00:22:27,280
not this week's tutorial,

326
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,095
but next week's tutorial.

327
00:22:29,095 --> 00:22:31,150
There are three
functions on lists.

328
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,415
Had it gives you
the first element,

329
00:22:33,415 --> 00:22:36,970
tail gives you everything
but the first element,

330
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:43,345
the single colon is pronounced
Cons, short for construct.

331
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:45,160
And it just puts

332
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,230
a thing at the very
beginning of the list.

333
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,940
So one put at the
beginning of the list

334
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,850
to three, gives you 123.

335
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,640
And then here's a
property we could check.

336
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,605
Given a list of integers,

337
00:22:56,605 --> 00:22:59,690
either it should be
the empty list, right?

338
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,105
You can take the head or
tail of an empty list.

339
00:23:02,105 --> 00:23:03,935
So either it should
be the empty list

340
00:23:03,935 --> 00:23:05,885
or, oops, that's misspelled.

341
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,520
That should be
spelled vertical bar.

342
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,780
Vertical bar had x's colon
tail xs is equal to xs.

343
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,520
We can try that one out.

344
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,255
You know, there we go.

345
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:27,830
So there's the property.

346
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,170
Let's make this
screen what there?

347
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,300
So I wrote or in the
slide, I will fix it.

348
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,205
It should be double vertical bar.

349
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:38,060
And I can run this road
one mA and now again,

350
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,380
I can do the same thing.

351
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:48,190
Quick. Check. Prop head, tail.

352
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,710
Okay, passed 100 tests.

353
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,285
Knows if I got it wrong,

354
00:23:52,285 --> 00:23:53,875
it can help me find it right.

355
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,945
It's very important to
remember or you can't

356
00:23:55,945 --> 00:23:59,080
take head or tail
of the empty list.

357
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:05,390
So what if I leave this
out and do it again?

358
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,365
Failed falsifiable
after one test.

359
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:14,180
Doesn't work for the empty list.

360
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,635
Okay, so what have we learn?

361
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:22,810
Number is Tikki, Tikki,

362
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:27,470
Tikki lists, list comprehensions.

363
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,865
Rush. Do it twice.

364
00:24:31,865 --> 00:24:33,800
The computer can help

365
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,220
you check that what you've
done is consistent,

366
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,170
that the property, if you
believe, should hold,

367
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:43,110
do whole and can
reveal errors for you.
