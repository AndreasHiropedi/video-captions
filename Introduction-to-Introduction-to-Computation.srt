1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,945
Hi, my name's Phil Wadler,

2
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:12,340
and this is the introduction to

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,455
the introduction to computation,

4
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:16,930
which is Informatics1A.

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,270
This is Lecture Zero.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,500
You'll find out why it's

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,624
Lecture Zero later in the course.

8
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:28,195
So let's begin by
talking about who.

9
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,670
Hi, I'm Philip Wadler.

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,780
I'm the lecturer for the

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,670
functional programming
part of the course,

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,055
and I am also the Course Head.

13
00:00:36,055 --> 00:00:38,605
There's my email and
my office number.

14
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,390
The email will do you some good,

15
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,070
the office number less so.

16
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,410
This is Michael Fourman.

17
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,270
He's the lecturer
for the computation

18
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,385
and logic part of the course,

19
00:00:49,385 --> 00:00:51,740
and he's left a wee message for you.

20
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,320
I'm here to blow away
the cobwebs while

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,970
preparing for the start of term,
Fresher's week

22
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,895
next week and looking forward
to seeing you all here.

23
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,860
This is Edinburgh.

24
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,185
This is Arthur's Seat.

25
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:11,570
Magnificent. 
Plenty of wind,

26
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,430
so the air's clean and plenty of

27
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,920
natural vegetation when
you're outside. Now I'm sorry

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,065
I won't be inside
with you for awhile.

29
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:20,180
But we're going to
do things online

30
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,970
and I'm looking
forward to meeting

31
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:29,075
you all next week.
Thank you, Michael.

32
00:01:29,075 --> 00:01:32,390
This is Claudia Chirita.

33
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,325
She is the teaching assistant
for the course.

34
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:36,980
She's been doing a
huge amount to help

35
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,665
getting everything ready,
among other things.

36
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:41,990
She's responsible for
putting up the material on

37
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,425
Learn where you will
be accessing it.

38
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:47,975
This is Don Sannella.

39
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,990
He is another professor at
the University of Edinburgh,

40
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,240
just like Michael and myself.

41
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,710
He used to teach on

42
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,020
this course and he
spent his sabbatical

43
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,820
writing a textbook for you

44
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,775
based on the material
in this course.

45
00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:05,375
And we'll have more about
that textbook a bit later.

46
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,550
This is Heather Yorston.

47
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,250
She gives a set of
optional lectures,

48
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,274
Mathematics for Computing.

49
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:14,735
These will be available
pre recorded,

50
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,165
just like the lectures
from Michael and myself.

51
00:02:17,165 --> 00:02:19,310
Lectures from Michael and me will

52
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,700
be required for you to listen to.

53
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,590
Hers are optional in case you

54
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,765
want more background
in mathematics,

55
00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:28,790
which is very useful.
If you don't have

56
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,320
a strong background, then

57
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,405
these lectures are
there to help you out.

58
00:02:32,405 --> 00:02:34,220
And everybody on the
course will, of course,

59
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,170
help you out with any
questions you have

60
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,395
about mathematics
or anything else.

61
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:42,155
This is Perdita Stevens.

62
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:46,100
She's the author of a textbook
'How to Write Good Programs',

63
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,450
which among other things,

64
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,710
is aimed at this course,

65
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,645
so you might want to
get that textbook.

66
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:53,210
I'll say more about
textbooks later.

67
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,065
She's served as a tutor on
this course for many years.

68
00:02:57,065 --> 00:03:00,080
She's an excellent tutor and
she's going to be helping

69
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,715
me this year to supervise
the online tutorials.

70
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:06,650
More on that later too.

71
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,360
This is Paul Anderson.

72
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,595
He's in charge of all of the

73
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:13,025
Informatics1
first-year courses.

74
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:15,840
So he's in charge
of the entire year.

75
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,320
This is Laura Ambrose.

76
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,290
She works in the Informatics
Teaching Organization

77
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,230
and she's responsible
for the administrative side

78
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,300
of the course.
If you need to do

79
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,790
something like change the
time of your tutorial,

80
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,905
she is the person to speak to.

81
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:33,260
So all of these
emails are here, these

82
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,495
slides will be
online via Learn,

83
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:38,690
so it'll be easy for you to
get this information.

84
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,390
Let me tell you a bit about Where.

85
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,759
I mentioned the Informatics
Teaching Organization.

86
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,080
So let's explain things.

87
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,175
Here's the Informatics Forum.

88
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:52,445
This is where Michael
and I have offices.

89
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:54,230
Here's Appleton Tower.

90
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,870
This is where the ITO is located.

91
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,640
Of course, given circumstances,

92
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,830
you might not go to
these things at all.

93
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,150
But I'm showing you where they

94
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,950
are in case that's helpful.

95
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,450
And another thing
I'll show you is

96
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,160
right here's the general area.

97
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,870
Here's the Informatics Forum.

98
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,325
Here's Appleton Tower.

99
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:13,835
And up here is Blackwells Bookshop.

100
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:15,470
I just happened to be in there

101
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,910
yesterday. So here's Blackwells

102
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,210
Bookshop. Bookshops
are an amazing thing.

103
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:23,345
The web and Amazon
is killing them off,

104
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:25,220
but there's still
an amazing thing.

105
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,920
Among other things, you
might want a physical book.

106
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,750
If you do, I encourage
you to get it

107
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,420
from Blackwells or some
other physical bookshop.

108
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,870
Of course, you can get it
online as well if you prefer.

109
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,960
And in fact, these are
the computing shelves

110
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,195
at Blackwells. Always
worth a visit.

111
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:44,195
And part of those shelves,
here are the textbooks

112
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:48,140
available for the course
if you want them.

113
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,240
And I'll say a bit
more about that.

114
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,325
So what are the textbooks
for the course?

115
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,035
So first and foremost,

116
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:58,130
there is the new textbook
that Don Sanella has written.

117
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,820
There will be forums

118
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,715
available for feedback via Learn.

119
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:06,560
Your feedback is very much

120
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,030
encouraged to help make this

121
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,800
even better for
students next year.

122
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,670
This is our first year trialing
out this new textbook.

123
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,730
There's some other textbooks
that we've used in the past.

124
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,290
One is 'Haskell, the craft of

125
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,585
functional programming'
by Simon Thompson.

126
00:05:21,585 --> 00:05:26,320
And another is Learn You a
Haskell for Great Good.

127
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,495
By Miran Lipovaca.

128
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,750
They're both available
as physical books and

129
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,305
Learn You a Haskell is also
available for free online.

130
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:37,225
So you might want
to check those out.

131
00:05:37,225 --> 00:05:39,460
Whatever resource
is helpful to you,

132
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,275
I urge you to get. Textbooks,
if it's physical cost money.

133
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:45,670
Sometimes they cost, you know,

134
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,875
they cost 50 pounds,

135
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,155
which seems like a
huge amount of money.

136
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:53,440
But if you think about what

137
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,570
the Scottish government invest in

138
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,509
the students here for
one years course,

139
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:00,715
50 pounds is nothing.

140
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:04,375
If you need to spend 50
pounds to make good use...

141
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,670
of the course, of the opportunities

142
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,945
available through the course,

143
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:09,520
that is a bargain.

144
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,280
So I encourage you
to consider it.

145
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,760
And if you think it's
helpful, go ahead and do it.

146
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,610
Here's how to write
good programs.

147
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,100
Perdita's book, which
I mentioned before.

148
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,295
This is not a textbook
for the course per se,

149
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:27,430
but has lots of advice about how
to write good programs,

150
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,305
including Haskell programs,

151
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,280
which is what we're going to be

152
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,115
doing in the functional
programming part of the course.

153
00:06:33,115 --> 00:06:35,110
And Haskell will also play

154
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,490
an important role in

155
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,980
the computation and logic
part of the course.

156
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,060
So again, check this book
out. If it's helpful for you,

157
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,115
I encourage you to get it.

158
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:48,850
How? So we're going to have

159
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,630
lectures, pre recorded, each week.

160
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,790
There will be
roughly two hours of

161
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,960
functional programming
lectures recorded by myself,

162
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,810
two hours of computation
and logic lectures

163
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,655
recorded by Michael Fourman.

164
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:06,070
The functional programming
lectures are mainly going

165
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,800
to be those recorded last year.

166
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,030
That's because I think I work
better with an audience.

167
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,560
I think you will enjoy

168
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,515
better those things
recorded with an audience.

169
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:19,150
Michael has decided to take

170
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,580
advantage of the new
world, while your in,

171
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,390
and he's going to be doing

172
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,280
the computation
and logic lectures

173
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,065
in a different style.

174
00:07:26,065 --> 00:07:29,565
We're all learning
as we move forward.

175
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:31,460
I thought the best
thing to give you is

176
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,260
pre-recorded lectures
from last year.

177
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,510
We'll see how that goes.

178
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,400
Everybody on the course,

179
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,140
including Michael and myself,

180
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,120
will be soliciting feedback

181
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,550
from you as the course proceeds.

182
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,860
Now, we really want to

183
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,290
encourage you to
view these lectures.

184
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,090
So for the FP part of the course,

185
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,275
there's going to be a quiz

186
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:53,570
each week based on the lectures.

187
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,100
And for the CL part,

188
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,465
there's going to be a test

189
00:07:56,465 --> 00:08:00,590
every other week based on the
material in the lectures.

190
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,890
But, and this is
really important:

191
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,900
Lectures are not enough.

192
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,210
Where you're going to do
most of the learning.

193
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,215
I am sad to say, is not
through me talking at you,

194
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:14,900
saying wonderful
bits of knowledge.

195
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,630
You learn things by doing them.

196
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,390
And your opportunity
to do things and

197
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,270
get feedback is the tutorials.

198
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,970
So we're going to have a one hour

199
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,344
live tutorial each week for
functional programming.

200
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:32,210
We're going to have
a 1.5 hour live

201
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,825
tutorial each week for
computation and logic.

202
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:39,365
These are done in large groups
and then subgroups of six.

203
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:41,870
These are done in groups of ten.

204
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,240
You will have a tutor assigned to

205
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,090
you who you can go
to for feedback.

206
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,685
So this is really important.

207
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:53,885
So we've got a tutorial that
you must do each week for

208
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:57,680
FP, and a tutorial each
that you must do each week

209
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,920
for computation and logic.

210
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,820
There are also live
demonstrations every

211
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,740
weekday from just after four
o'clock to five o'clock.

212
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,695
These are not required,
but they're optional.

213
00:09:12,695 --> 00:09:14,180
But again, there's a live

214
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,505
demonstrated there who can
deal with your questions.

215
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:18,605
They're are a good place
to go to get help.

216
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:22,325
Another good place to go
to get help is Piazza.

217
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:24,890
You can put up questions
at anytime and

218
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,540
any other student and

219
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,180
the staff will put up 
answers to those questions.

220
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,300
It's a very effective
means of getting feedback.

221
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,480
Another very important
effective means of getting

222
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,455
feedback is your
colleagues, your peers.

223
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:41,690
There is InfPALS,

224
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,640
which has people in

225
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,830
successive years who've
been through this course.

226
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,285
You can go to them for feedback

227
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:49,790
or just make friends
on the course,

228
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,125
talk to other people,

229
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,670
work with other people.

230
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,390
It's very much encouraged
that you use every resource

231
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,550
available from the staff

232
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,800
through to other
students to learn.

233
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,380
It's important that
you do the work.

234
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,160
Attendance at tutorials
is compulsory,

235
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,735
it is not optional.

236
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:14,975
You must listen to the
lectures each week,

237
00:10:14,975 --> 00:10:16,925
before the tutorial.

238
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:20,090
You must do the assigned
reading each week

239
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,629
that will be available on
Learn before the tutorial.

240
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:26,765
You must do the
tutorial exercises

241
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:30,630
each week before the tutorial.

242
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,985
And that is so important
that if I was live,

243
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:37,640
I would be jumping
up and down to tell

244
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,565
you how important that
is, but I'm not live,

245
00:10:40,565 --> 00:10:42,290
I can't really jump up and down.

246
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,625
So instead of that,

247
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:49,170
what I've got here is a
little dancing teddy bear.

248
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,905
And he is dancing and
jumping up and down.

249
00:10:53,905 --> 00:10:57,130
Very angry to tell you just how

250
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,385
important it is that
you do the work.

251
00:11:00,385 --> 00:11:02,470
So I'm just going to repeat this.

252
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,870
You wouldn't think I
need to repeat it.

253
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,020
But experience shows students
believe that they can get

254
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,975
away for some
reason without doing this,

255
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:15,460
I already mentioned just
how much money is

256
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,710
given by the Scottish government

257
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,455
to ensure these resources
are available to you.

258
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:23,350
So really it's very
important that you use them.

259
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,550
You must listen to

260
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,620
the lectures each week
before the tutorial.

261
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,720
You must do the assigned reading

262
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,775
each week before the tutorial,

263
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:33,785
you must do the tutorial exercises

264
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:37,079
each week before the tutorial.

265
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,820
You may collaborate.

266
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,500
When you are doing these things,

267
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,345
especially this
tutorial exercises,

268
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:45,800
you're encouraged to collaborate.

269
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,575
As I said, other
students are resource.

270
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,620
It's all too easy if you're
working with another student

271
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,995
who's stronger than you to
let them do all the work.

272
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:57,830
But you have to submit
your own answers.

273
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,815
You are responsible for
knowing the material.

274
00:12:00,815 --> 00:12:03,425
If you copy somebody
else's work directly,

275
00:12:03,425 --> 00:12:06,740
that is cheating. Don't do that.

276
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:12,290
But working with other students
to learn, that's fine.

277
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,110
And again, let me
state the obvious.

278
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,380
You will fail the course
if you don't do the work.

279
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,140
That's in italics
to emphasize it.

280
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,160
And here's the teddy bear
to emphasize that as well.

281
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,635
Now, to encourage you to do this,

282
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:33,140
the weave, all of

283
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,095
the work that I just mentioned
is going to be assessed.

284
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:37,550
So you have a reason to do it.

285
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,475
You know that you're getting
points for doing it.

286
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:42,635
So there's a 100
marks for the course.

287
00:12:42,635 --> 00:12:45,425
50 of those are for
functional programming,

288
00:12:45,425 --> 00:12:48,770
50 of those are for
computation and logic.

289
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,885
To pass the course,

290
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:54,095
you must pass each
of those separately.

291
00:12:54,095 --> 00:12:59,480
You must get 20 out of 50 marks
in each of those to pass.

292
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,210
So here, the 50 marks for FP,

293
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,329
there's a quiz each week worth 1 piint.

294
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:07,370
There's a tutorial each week,

295
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,435
which will be marked by your
tutor worth four points.

296
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:16,940
There is a mid-term
also worth four points.

297
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,960
It will be essentially like

298
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,790
a tutorial and marked
by your tutor.

299
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,220
And there will be a final, again,

300
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,920
it's four points, 
essentially like a tutorial.

301
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,355
The midterm and
the final are there.

302
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:30,170
You can see they're a relatively

303
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,790
small part of the assessment,

304
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,039
but they are there to
give you feedback.

305
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,410
As I mentioned, you
might be working with

306
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,185
other students to
do the tutorials.

307
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,090
Don't work with other students

308
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,085
to do the midterm or the final,

309
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:45,965
that will give you some feedback
on what you've learned.

310
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:47,540
Now if you add these up,

311
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,435
you see we've got 40 points,

312
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:51,605
sorry, ten points here.

313
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:56,225
One times 10, 4 times ten
is 40, plus 10 is 50.

314
00:13:56,225 --> 00:14:00,710
But then we've got another
four points for the midterm,

315
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,150
four points for the final.

316
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,435
But of these 12 items,

317
00:14:05,435 --> 00:14:09,440
you will be scored on
the best 10 of 12.

318
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,990
So if you miss a
tutorial one week

319
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,705
or do very poorly on
something for some reason,

320
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:17,195
that won't count
as long as you do

321
00:14:17,195 --> 00:14:20,550
well enough on the rest.

322
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,690
For computation and logic,

323
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,685
the assessment is
a bit different.

324
00:14:25,685 --> 00:14:29,585
There is a test every other
week worth four points,

325
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:32,840
and a tutorial each
week worth two points,

326
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,910
and then a final
worth ten points,

327
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:40,890
and those add up to
exactly 50. I should say,

328
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,820
and then on Learn,

329
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,980
so all the resources that you

330
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,525
need will be published on Learn,

331
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:49,460
including the video that

332
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,095
you're watching right now for me,

333
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:53,390
all of our pre recorded
video lectures

334
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,950
will be available on Learn.

335
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,780
All the slides will
be available on

336
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,535
Learn, all the
reading assignments,

337
00:14:58,535 --> 00:15:00,634
all the tutorial assignments.

338
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:02,885
Once they're done,
all the solutions,

339
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:05,525
everything will be
put up on Learn.

340
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:07,280
There'll be a programming
competition for

341
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,350
FP later this year that will be

342
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,970
posted on Learn. Everything you

343
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,505
need, the link to the piazza site,

344
00:15:13,505 --> 00:15:17,300
everything will be
available on Learn.

345
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,755
Let me say a word about When.

346
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:25,490
So this is the actual timetable.

347
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,230
It actually has lectures as

348
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,985
specific time in it right now.

349
00:15:28,985 --> 00:15:30,620
We're going to remove
that because you

350
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,170
can see the Lectures
anytime you want.

351
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,670
Very important, right?

352
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,490
These are the demonstrations
which I mentioned,

353
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:42,335
which will be every weekday
four o'clock to five o'clock,

354
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,810
live, great place
to get feedback.

355
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,660
There will also be office hours.

356
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,915
Michael will have one
office hour each week.

357
00:15:50,915 --> 00:15:53,045
I will have an office
hour each week.

358
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:54,920
When those hours to be decided,

359
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,345
that will be posted on Learn.

360
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:58,025
A lot of things are
probably going to

361
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:00,815
change as the course
goes forward.

362
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:03,065
Because this is new to all of us.

363
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:04,910
And we're hoping to
get feedback from

364
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,415
you on what works
and what doesn't.

365
00:16:07,415 --> 00:16:09,410
Piazza and e-mail will be

366
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,270
great ways of delivering
that feedback.

367
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,095
So things will change.

368
00:16:15,095 --> 00:16:16,475
Again, it will be very important.

369
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,260
Look at Learn, that
we'll always have the

370
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,630
most up to date information.

371
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,970
One thing I should mention
about the tutorials.

372
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,220
You can see that
the computation and

373
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,235
logic tutorials will be near
the beginning of the week,

374
00:16:31,235 --> 00:16:32,990
probably all on Monday.

375
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,480
The FP tutorials
will all be near

376
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,720
the end of the week,
probably on Friday.

377
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,365
I believe what we're going
to do is have a Wednesday

378
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:44,720
four o'clock deadline for the

379
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,020
FP tutorials on Friday.

380
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,855
And that will give your
tutors time to mark them.

381
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:54,695
Again, this will all be on Learn.

382
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:59,855
And the CL work will
also have a deadline,

383
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:01,385
but that's yet to be decided.

384
00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:03,575
It will be on Learn.

385
00:17:03,575 --> 00:17:07,730
Finally, Why. Right, you

386
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,745
want to know a little bit about
why we're doing all this.

387
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:12,620
But I'm not going to cover that

388
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,765
in the introductory lecture.

389
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:18,560
I, Michael and I will
be covering the Why of

390
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,675
functional programming
part of the course

391
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:23,750
and the computation and
logic part of the course

392
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,315
at the beginning of
our first lectures,

393
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:28,670
which you will see,

394
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,115
which will be available
to you online.

395
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:34,220
But I will just give you a hint.

396
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,610
It has something to do
with the lambda calculus.

397
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,075
Here is my fuzzy lambda
that was made as a little

398
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:43,670
warm, fuzzy toy for
me by my daughter.

399
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,725
And you'll learn more
about fuzzy lambdas

400
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:47,345
later in the course.

401
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:50,735
That's it. That's the
introduction completed.

402
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:57,170
Welcome! to Introduction to
Computation Informatics1A.

403
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,240
This has been the
Introduction to

404
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,350
the Introduction to
Computation. Go well.
